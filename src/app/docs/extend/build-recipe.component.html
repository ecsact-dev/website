		<p>
			Ecsact build recipes are YAML files that configure a build for a
			<a routerLink="/docs/runtime-implementations">runtime implementation</a>.
			These recipe files get consumed by the
			<a routerLink="/start/cli">Ecsact CLI</a> <code>build</code> subcommand.

		<h1 id="how-to-use">How to use an Ecsact Build Recipe</h1>
		<p>
			Build recipes are usually used in an integration pretty seemlessly. Most
			of the time you won't even need to pay attention to it. If customizing the
			build recipe is available there should be a dropdown or a simple way to
			select build recipes in the game engine integration settings.
		</p>
		<p>
			For custom integrations or projects not using an engine you'll want to use
			the <a routerLink="/start/cli">Ecsact CLI</a>{{ ' ' }}
			<code>build</code> subcommand directly.

		<h1 id="writing-a-build-recipe">Writing a build recipe</h1>
		<p>
			Writing a build recipe is simple, but creating an Ecsact runtime
			implementation is no trivial feat. For that reason, learning how to write
			a build recipe is considered an advanced topic.
		</p>
		<p>
			Build recipes are likely going to change dramatically as Ecsact develops.
			For that reason this article is not going to dive deep into the build
			recipe YAML format. Instead we'll go over the high level concepts and some
			recommendations for distributing your build recipes. If that doesn't scare
			you away then take a look at the
			<a
				href="https://github.com/ecsact-dev/ecsact_rt_entt/blob/main/build_recipe.yml"
				target="_blank"
				class="whitespace-nowrap">
				<span class="i24">open_in_new</span> ecsact_rt_entt build recipe</a
			>
			for an example.
		</p>

		<h2 id="build-recipe-sources">Sources</h2>
		<p>
			The build recipe includes a list of sources that are required to build the
			runtime implementation. Source files include programming language source
			files or codegen plugins that should run on the <code>.ecsact</code> files
			included when building the runtime.
		</p>

		<h2 id="build-recipe-exports">Exports</h2>
		<p>
			A list of exported Ecsact runtime module functions are listed in the build
			recipe. These are functions that the runtime implementation implements.
			The exported functions will be used by another runtime (<a
				routerLink="/docs/extend/build-recipe"
				fragment="build-recipe-imports"
				>see imports</a
			>) or by the game or game engine directly.
		</p>

		<h2 id="build-recipe-imports">Imports</h2>
		<p>
			A list of imported Ecsact runtime module functions are listed in the build
			recipe. These are functions that the
			<a routerLink="/docs/extend/build-recipe" fragment="build-recipe-exports"
				>exported functions</a
			>
			utilise at runtime. This allows multiple recipes to be combined to create
			a single runtime.
		</p>

		<h2 id="build-recipe-distribution">Distribution</h2>
		<p>
			Distributing a build recipe YAML file is fine, but it does have some down
			sides. Namely all the source files and codegen plugins need to be
			carefully placed next to the build recipe in order for them to be
			discoverable. This can be error proned when developers are installing your
			build recipe. Instead we recommend using the
			<a routerLink="/start/cli">Ecsact CLI</a>
			<code>recipe-bundle</code> command which will generate a
			<code>.ecsact-recipe-bundle</code> with all your source files and plugins
			all packaged neatly into 1 file.

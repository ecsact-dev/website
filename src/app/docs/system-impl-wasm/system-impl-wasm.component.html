	<h1>Wasm Systems Overview</h1>
	<p>
		<a href="https://webassembly.org/" target="_blank">Wasm</a> (or Web
		Assembly) is a portable binary format perfectly suitable for executing code
		you write on the web or embedded in another program. Ecsact supports having
		your system implementations in the Wasm format. System implementations
		compiled to Wasm are the best all around way for a working with Ecsact.
	</p>
	<p>
		This article should give you everything you need to know in order to create
		a <strong>valid</strong> system implementation <code>.wasm</code> file.
	</p>
	<h2 id="imports-and-exports">Wasm Imports & Exports</h2>
	<p>
		Only certain exports of a <code>.wasm</code> file are used by the ecsact
		runtime and a limited set of imports are allowed. Valid exports are only
		functions with the system execution signature. Exports that do not meet that
		requirement are completely ignored. Imports are much more strict than
		exports. The only imports that are allowed are
		<code>ecsact_system_execution_context_*</code> functions from the ecsact
		runtime.
	</p>
	<p>
		The system implementation signature in <code>wasm32</code> would look like
		this:
	</p>
	<pre><code>
		(func (param i32) (result void) ...)
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Fortunately wasm works natively in the browser which means we can easily
		have a validator right here for you to try! Input your
		<code>.wasm</code> file down below and we'll show your exports and imports
		and whether or not they are suitable to use with Ecsact.

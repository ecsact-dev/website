	<h1>Ecsact Runtime Library</h1>
	<p>
		The Ecsact runtime is a comprised of a low-level C library split into
		several modules. Modules may be fully or partially implemented depending on
		the
		<a [routerLink]="[]" fragment="runtime-configurations">configuration</a> and
		the
		<a routerLink="/docs/runtime-implementations"
			><span class="i24">article</span> implementation</a
		>.
	</p>
	<h2 id="modules">Modules</h2>

	<h3 id="core-module">Core</h3>
	<p>
		The core module deals with storage and system execution on that storage.
		Entities and their components' data are stored inside a <em>registry</em>.
		Systems and actions are executed on a registry's stored entities and their
		components based on the system or actions capabilities.
	</p>
	<p>
		Module methods are available in
		<a routerLink="/reference/ecsact_runtime/core_8h" fragment="functions"
			><span class="i24">article</span> ecsact/runtime/core.h</a
		>
	</p>

	<h3 id="dynamic-module">Dynamic</h3>
	<p>
		The dynamic module is responsible for creating new <em>types</em> and even
		packages at runtime. A type includes enums, components, systems and actions.
		Everything you can create when writing an Ecsact file you can do
		programatically with the dynamic module.
	</p>
	<p>
		Module methods are available in
		<a routerLink="/reference/ecsact_runtime/dynamic_8h" fragment="functions"
			><span class="i24">article</span> ecsact/runtime/dynamic.h</a
		>
	</p>

	<h3 id="meta-module">Meta</h3>
	<p>
		The meta module reveals extra information about the runtime. This includes
		debug information, type names, composite fields, system capabilities and
		much more. This module isn't needed for simulation and is mostly used for
		debugging and tooling.
	</p>
	<p>
		Module methods are available in
		<a routerLink="/reference/ecsact_runtime/meta_8h" fragment="functions"
			><span class="i24">article</span> ecsact/runtime/meta.h</a
		>
	</p>

	<h3 id="serialize-module">Serialize</h3>
	<p>
		The serialize module gives a simple API for serializing composites. Useful
		for saving simulation state or sending information over a network.
	</p>
	<p>
		Module methods are available in
		<a routerLink="/reference/ecsact_runtime/serialize_8h" fragment="functions"
			><span class="i24">article</span> ecsact/runtime/serialize.h</a
		>
	</p>

	<h3 id="static-module">Static</h3>
	<p>
		The static module reveals a set of components, systems, and actions that
		were available at compile-time when the runtime was built.
	</p>
	<p>
		Module methods are available in
		<a routerLink="/reference/ecsact_runtime/static_8h" fragment="functions"
			><span class="i24">article</span> ecsact/runtime/static.h</a
		>
	</p>

	<h2 id="runtime-configurations">Runtime Configurations</h2>
	<p>
		A runtime configuration is the list of functions available (exported) in the
		Ecsact runtime C library.
	</p>

	<h3 id="runtime-config-minimal">Minimal Runtime</h3>
	<p>
		Implements the smallest set of methods to have a functional runtime library.
		A minimal runtime is built specifically for a project where all components,
		systems, and actions were known at compile-time.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><code>ecsact_create_registry</code></li>
		<li><code>ecsact_execute_systems</code></li>
	</ul>

	<h3 id="runtime-config-generic">Minimal Generic Runtime</h3>
	<p>
		Same as the
		<a [routerLink]="[]" fragment="runtime-config-minimal">Minimal Runtime</a>
		while also implementing all the methods in the
		<a [routerLink]="[]" fragment="dynamic-module">dynamic module</a>. The
		dynamic module makes a runtime generic because components, systems, and
		actions from any project can use this runtime.
	</p>

	<h3 id="runtime-config-tooling">Tooling Runtime</h3>
	Implements enough of the
	<a [routerLink]="[]" fragment="dynamic-module">dynamic module</a> to create
	types and enough of the
	<a [routerLink]="[]" fragement="meta-module">meta module</a> to get all the
	information relating to those types. The configuration is called 'tooling'
	because it's used for Ecsact development tooling such as autocomplete, code
	generation, semantic highlighting, and doesn't have the functionality to be
	useful in a simulation.

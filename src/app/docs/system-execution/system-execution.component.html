	<h1>System Execution</h1>
	<p>System execution is an important part of Ecsact.</p>

	<h2 id="execution-order">Execution Order</h2>
	<p>
		System execution order is determined by the declaration order in your ecsact
		file.
	</p>
	<pre><code ecsactLangSyntax>
		system Foo {{ '{ /* ... */ }' }}
		action Bar {{ '{ /* ... */ }' }}
		system Baz {{ '{ /* ... */ }' }}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		In the above example the systems and actions are executed in order
		<code>Foo</code>, <code>Bar</code>, and then <code>Baz</code>. If systems or
		actions do not have <a>conflicting component capabilities</a> they may
		<a>execute in parallel</a>. This makes your system and action declaration
		order a design and performance decision.
	</p>

	<h2 id="parallel-execution">Parallel Execution</h2>
	<p>
		Systems and actions that do not have conflciting component capabilities are
		able to execute in parallel. This is not guaranteed for every runtime
		implementation and is more of an implementation detail. However, it is
		valuable to know in order to design performant Ecsact files.
	</p>

	<h3 id="conflicting-component-capabilities">
		Conflicting Component Capabilities
	</h3>
	<p>
		Conflicting capabilities are system and action capabilities that do not
		allow a system or action from executing in parallel with each other.
		Generally speaking all write operations on the same components may not be
		done in parallel. This includes <code>readwrite</code>, <code>adds</code>,
		<code>removes</code>, and <code>generate</code>.
	</p>

	<h3 id="lanes-and-steps">Execution Lanes & Steps</h3>
	<p>
		Parallel execution is split into lanes and steps. For every lane there are 1
		or more steps and for every step there are or 1 or more systems & actions.
		Every system in a step can be executed in parallel and every lane can
		execute in parallel.
	</p>
	<pre><code ecsactLangSyntax>
		package example;

		component Health {{ '{' }} f32 value; {{ '}' }}
		component Position {{ '{' }} f32 x; f32 y; {{ '}' }}
		component Velocity {{ '{' }} f32 vel_x; f32 vel_y; {{ '}' }}
		component Poisoned {{ '{' }} f32 potency; {{ '}' }}
		component Flying;
		component Player;
		component PoisonGeyser;

		action Fly {{'{'}}
			include Player;
			adds Flying;
		{{'}'}}

		system Gravity {{ '{' }}
			readwrite Velocity;
			exclude Flying;
		{{ '}' }}

		action Move {{'{'}}
			f32 dir_x;
			f32 dir_y;
			readwrite Velocity;
		{{'}'}}

		system {{ '{' }}
			readonly Position;
			include PoisonGeyser;
			system PoisonNearby {{ '{' }}
				readonly Position;
				adds Poisoned;
			{{ '}'}}
		{{ '}' }}

		system ApplyPoisonDamage {{ '{' }}
			readwrite Health;
			readonly Poisoned;
		{{ '}' }}
		
		transient PoisonExpired;
		system PoisonDecay {{ '{' }}
			readwrite Poisoned;
			adds PoisonExpired;
		{{ '}' }}

		system {{ '{' }}
			include PoisonExpired;
			removes Poisoned;
		{{ '}' }}

		system ApplyVelocity {{ '{' }}
			readonly Velocity;
			readwrite Position;
		{{ '}' }}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		In the above example there is a single lane with 5 steps, 2 of which have
		parallel execution.

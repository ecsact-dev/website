	<p>
		Entity Component System (ECS) is an architecture that uses data assocation
		over traditional methods like inheritance. It's been most commonly used in
		video game development. We'll give a brief overview in relation to Ecsact,
		but you can read more about ECS on
		<a

		>.
	</p>

	<h2 id="entities">Entities</h2>
	<p>
		An entitiy is a unique identifer that can be associated with zero or more
		unique components. Components can be added or removed from the entity
		dynamically.
	</p>

	<h2 id="components">Components</h2>
	<p>
		A component holds data and associates with an entity. Components don't
		define behaviour, they provide state for systems.
	</p>

	<pre><code ecsactLangSyntax>
		// Creates a component in Ecsact called Health
		component Health {{'{'}}
			// Maintains the state of how much "health" an entity has
			i32 value;
		{{'}'}}

		// A tag to associate an entity with being "dead"
		component Dead;
	</code></pre>

	<h2 id="systems">Systems</h2>
	<p>
		A system is a defined function that matches with entities meeting its
		capabilities. They can add, remove, and manipulate the data on components.
		This changes the behaviour of an entity and alters state through its
		associated components.
	</p>
	<pre><code ecsactLangSyntax>
		// This system is run for every "alive" entity that has a Health Component
		system CheckDead {{'{'}}
			readonly Health;
			// If the value of health is 0, the entity will be considered dead
			adds Dead;
		{{'}'}}
	</code></pre>

	<h2 id="benefits">Benefits to using ECS</h2>
	<ul class="space-y-4">
		<li>
			<h3 class="inline text-base font-bold">Flexible and Reusable</h3>
			— ECS uses composition instead of inheritance. Meaning instead of a
			hierarchy you create components representing different parts that can be
			mixed and matched together. Mixing and matching components allow you to
			change behaviour simply by adding or removing a component from an entity.
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3 class="inline text-base font-bold">Maintainable</h3>
			— Code bases can get bloated. Decoupling behaviour in systems prevent you
			from getting lost in classes or subclasses. All systems operate
			independent from each other, allowing the developer to focus on one
			section of code at a time.
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3 class="inline text-base font-bold">Performance</h3>
			— Todays processors work concurrently on multiple cores and threads. Even
			your average smart phone has a high performance multi-core processor. In
			ECS, entities are stored as simple integers and components are organized
			by their type as separate cache-friendly lists. Both of which allow for
			<em>blazingly fast</em> iteration.

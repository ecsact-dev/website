	<p>
		Entity Component System (ECS) is an architecture that uses data assocation
		over traditional methods like inheritance. It's been most commonly used in
		video game development. We'll give a brief overview in relation to Ecsact,
		but you can read more about ECS on

	<h2 id="entities">Entities</h2>
	<p>
		An entitiy is a unique identifer that can be associated with zero or more
		unique components. Components can be added or removed from the entity
		dynamically.
	</p>

	<h2 id="components">Components</h2>
	<p>
		A component holds data and associates with an entity. Components don't
		define behaviour, they provide state for systems.
	</p>

	<pre><code ecsactLangSyntax>
		// Creates a component in Ecsact called Health
		component Health {{'{'}}
			// Maintains the state of how much "health" an entity has
			i32 value;
		{{'}'}}

		// A tag to associate an entity with being "dead"
		component Dead;
	</code></pre>

	<h2 id="systems">Systems</h2>
	<p>
		A system is a defined function that matches with entities meeting its
		capabilities. They can add, remove, and manipulate the data on components.
		This changes the behaviour of an entity and alters state through its
		associated components.
	</p>
	<pre><code ecsactLangSyntax>
		// This system is run for every "alive" entity that has a Health Component
		system CheckDead {{'{'}}
			readonly Health;
			// If the value of health is 0, the entity will be considered dead
			adds Dead;
		{{'}'}}
	</code></pre>

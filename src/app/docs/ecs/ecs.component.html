	<h1 id="ecs">What is ECS?</h1>
	<p>
		ECS stands for Entity Component System. It's an architecture that uses data
		assocation over traditional methods like inheritance. Up to this point it's
		been most commonly used for designing video games (Although it can and has
		been used elsewhere)
	</p>

	<h2 id="entities">Entities</h2>
	<p>
		An entitiy is a unique identifer that can hold zero or more components.
		Components can be added or removed from the entity dynamically
	</p>

	<h2 id="components">Components</h2>
	<p>
		A component is a datatype that can be attached to an entity. Components
		don't hold any behaviours and provides ways to be iterated over in systems
	</p>

	<pre><code ecsactLangSyntax>
		// Creates a component in Ecsact with a Health component
		component Health {{'{'}}
			int32 value;
		{{'}'}}
	</code></pre>

	<h2 id="systems">Systems</h2>
	<p>
		A system iterates over entities with the request components. They can add,
		remove, and manipulate the data on components. This changes the behaviour of
		an entity and alters its state purely through the associated components
	</p>
	<pre><code ecsactLangSyntax>
		// This system iterates over every entity that has a Health Component
		system UpdateHealth {{'{'}}
			required Health;
		{{'}'}}
	</code></pre>

	<h2>Benefits to using ECS</h2>
	<p>
		ECS has high reusability and prevents creating constrictive design. With the
		right components, an entity can be anything
	</p>

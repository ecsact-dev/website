	<h1>Implementing Systems in Unity</h1>
	<p>
		The Ecsact Unity Integration allows implementations of your declared
		systems.

		<h2>System Declaration</h2>
		<p>
			Systems have a <code>C# Attribute</code> in its implementation. The type
			name of the system is put here to get the correct <code>context</code>.
			The context holds the logic of the system. This includes getting
			components, generating entities and retrieving data on actions.
		</p>
		<code-block-variation>
			<pre codeBlockVariationOption><code prism language="csharp">
[Ecsact.DefaultSystemImpl(typeof(example.ExampleSystem))]
public static void AddToExampleSystem(EcsactRuntime.SystemExecutionContext context) {{'{'}}
	// Get component from the context
	var value = context.Get<{{'example.Example'}}>();
{{'}'}}
			</code></pre>
		</code-block-variation>

		<p>
			It's essential that the system is both public and static. In addition, it
			needs to be part of the assembly that can be generated alongside your
			.Ecsact file in <code>edit -> Project Settings -> Ecsact</code>

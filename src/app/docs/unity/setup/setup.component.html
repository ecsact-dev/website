		<h2>Assembly</h2>
		<p>
			For systems to be registered into Ecsact, it needs to be part of an
			Assembly. In addition, it will need the following dependencies:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Ecsact</li>
			<li>EcsactCSharpSystemImplRuntime</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			After you've setup your assembly it needs to be set in
			<code>Edit -> ProjectSettings -> Ecsact</code> under System
			Implementations

			is very simple. All you have to do is go to
			<code>Edit->ProjectSettings->Ecsact</code> and checkmark

			Sync files automatically and add them to its pool which is listed below.

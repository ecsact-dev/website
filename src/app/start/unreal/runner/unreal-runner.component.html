	<h1>Ecsact Runner</h1>
	<p>
		The Ecsact Runner is a UObject that is automatically created when your game
		starts that executes your Ecsact systems. The Ecsact Unreal plugin comes
		with 2 runner classes.
		<a [routerLink]="[]" fragment="sync-runner"
			><code>UEcsactSyncRunner</code></a
		>
		and
		<a [routerLink]="[]" fragment="async-runner"
			><code>UEcsactAsyncRunner</code></a
		>. As the names imply one is synchronous and the other is asynchronous.
		Alternatively you may create a
		<a [routerLink]="[]" fragment="custom-runner">custom runner</a> or
		<a [routerLink]="[]" fragment="no-runner">no runner</a>
		at all. Keep reading to understand the differences between the different
		runners.
	</p>
	<p>
		By the default the Ecsact Unreal plugin is configured to automatically
		choose between the two depending on which Runtime API functions are
		available.
	</p>

		<h2 id="execution">Execution</h2>
		<p>
			Each runner implementation handles execution differently, but the API is
			the same.
		</p>
		<h3 id="execution-push-action">Executing Ecsact Actions</h3>
		<p>
			Executing an <a routerLink="/docs/lang" fragment="actions">action</a> is
			as simple as calling <code>PushAction</code> on your runner instance. This
			can be done anywhere on the game thread and the runner implementation will
			queue up the action as soon as possible. Make sure you include your
			<a routerLink="/start/unreal/codegen">code generated</a> Ecsact C++
			header.
		</p>

		<h3 id="execution-entity">Create & Destroy Entities</h3>
		<p>
			While its not often that you should need to create and destroy entities
			there are times it is necessary. The runner execution has two functions
			for easily creating and destroying entities. <code>CreateEntity</code> and
			<code>DestroyEntity</code>.
		</p>

					PlayerEntity = ECSACT_INVALID_ID(entity);
				{{'}'}}
			</code></pre>
		</code-block-variation>

		<h3 id="execution-add-component">Manipulating Components</h3>
		<p>
			Sometimes (but rarely) you'll even need to manipulate some components.
			Even though we recommend you use systems to read and write to components
			we have methods for conveniently doing so without.
		</p>

		<h2 id="sync-runner">Synchronous Runner</h2>
		<p>
			The <code>USyncRunner</code> runs
			<code>ecsact_execute_systems</code> every tick. Meaning that every tick
			your Ecsact systems will execute. If you derive from this class make sure
			you're calling <code>Super::Tick</code> or none of your
			<a routerLink="/start/unreal/subsystems">runner subsystems</a> will fire
			any Ecsact events. Your
			<a routerLink="/start/unreal/runtime" fragment="building-the-runtime"

			>
			must built to support the
			<a routerLink="/docs/runtime" fragment="core">core module</a> at least
			partially for this runner to work. No other module is required for this
			runner to work.
		</p>
		<p>
			All of the
			<a [routerLink]="[]" fragment="execution">runner execution methods</a> are
			added to an internal execution options list and will be passed to
			<code>ecsact_execute_systems</code> on the next tick.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2 id="async-runner">Asynchronous Runner</h2>
		<p>
			The <code>USyncRunner</code> runs
			<code>ecsact_async_flush_events</code> every tick. Meaning that all
			component events that have happened in the background will trigger every
			tick. If you derive from this class make sure you're calling
			<code>Super::Tick</code> or none of your
			<a routerLink="/start/unreal/subsystems">runner subsystems</a> will fire
			any Ecsact events. Your
			<a routerLink="/start/unreal/runtime" fragment="building-the-runtime"

			>
			must built to support the
			<a routerLink="/docs/runtime" fragment="async">async module</a> at least
			partially for this runner to work. No other module is required for this
			runner to work.
		</p>
		<p>
			All of the
			<a [routerLink]="[]" fragment="execution">runner execution methods</a> use
			the <code>ecsact_async_enqueue_execution_options</code> method under the
			hood making all execution options queued up asynchronous instantly.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2 id="custom-runner">Make your own Runner</h2>
		<p>
			Making your own runner can be the perfect way to control
			<em>ecsactly</em> how your Ecsact execution works. However, it's a bit of
			an under taking. Sometimes when you find yourself wanting to create a
			custom runner you really just want to
			<a [routerLink]="[]" fragment="control-runner-start"
				>control when your runner starts</a
			>
			instead.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you're still interested in creating your own runner then we recommend
			carefully studying the <code>UEcsactSyncRunner</code> or
			<code>UEcsactAsyncRunner</code>
			<a href="https://github.com/ecsact-dev/ecsact_unreal">source code</a>.
			Sometimes simplying deriving from one of the two is good enough.
		</p>
		<p>
			After you've created your Ecsact runner you can assign the
			<code>Custom Runner Class</code> in the Ecsact Unreal plugin settings. If
			you'd prefer to start it manually then set it to <code>None</code> and
			follow the
			<a [routerLink]="[]" fragment="control-runner-start">instructions below</a
			>.
		</p>

		<h3 id="control-runner-start">Control when your runner starts</h3>
		<div class="flex flex-col items-center">
			<p>
				If you don't like that your Ecsact runner starts right away and want to
				choose when it starts then you came to the right place. Go to
				<code>Edit Project Settings Plugins Ecsact</code> and set your Runner as
				<code>Custom</code> and the Custom Runner Class to <code>None</code>.
			</p>
			<div>
				<a href="/assets/unreal/unreal-custom-runner-01.png">
					<img
						class="rounded-lg shadow-lg"
						src="/assets/unreal/unreal-custom-runner-01.png" />
				</a>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>
			Now when your game starts nothing will happen. Fortunately this can be
			remedied with the by calling <code>StartCustomRunner</code> in the Ecsact
			game instance subsystem.
		</p>

				auto* EcsactGameInstanceSubsystem = GetWorld()-&gt;GetGameInstance()-&gt;GetSubsystem&lt;UEcsactGameInstanceSubsystem&gt;();

				EcsactGameInstanceSubsystem-&gt;StartCustomRunner&lt;UEcsactSyncRunner&gt;();

		<p>Afterwards your runner should be running!</p>

		<h2 id="no-runner">Using no runner</h2>
		<p>
			Choosing to use no runner disables a lot of the Ecsact Unreal plugin
			functionality. Consider using a
			<a [routerLink]="[]" fragment="custom-runner">custom runner</a> and
			<a [routerLink]="[]" fragment="control-runner-start"
				>manually controlling when it starts</a

			instead.

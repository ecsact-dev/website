	<h3 id="ecsact-runtime-api-access">Ecsact Runtime API Access</h3>
	<p>
		The heart and soul of an integration is the access to the
		<a routerLink="/docs/runtime"
			><span class="i24">article</span> Ecsact Runtime API</a
		>. All implemented methods in the runtime <strong>must</strong> be
		available. However, an integration may <em>disable</em> methods if a
		<a [routerLink]="[]" fragment="runtime-abstractions"
			>higher level abstraction</a
		>
		is able to be opt-in or gives equivalent functionality of said method. This
		gives the flexibility to control when and how runtime methods are called
		without removing runtime capabilities.
	</p>
	<h4 id="runtime-abstractions">Runtime Abstractions</h4>
	<p>
		Abstractions of the Ecsact Runtime API are encouraged to fit the practices
		and expectations of the framework/engine the integration is built for. While
		these abstractions should be tailored to the framework/engine at hand, here
		are some recommended abstractions:
	</p>
	<ul class="space-y-4 md:space-y-2">
		<li>
			<h5 id="automatic-system-execution" class="font-bold inline text-base">
				Automatic System Execution
			</h5>
			— Executing systems for most applications should happen as often as
			possible. Frameworks/engines usually have a <em>tick</em> or some kind of
			<em>event loop</em> that is perfectly suitable for executing systems.
			Simply taking the burdern off the developer and doing that for them is
			desirable. Occasionally an application requires very specific execution
			timing, but it's not common. For that reason we recommend this feature to
			be <em>opt-out</em>.
		</li>
		<li>
			<h5 id="relevant-codegen" class="font-bold inline text-base">
				Built-in relevant language codegen
			</h5>
			— Most frameworks/engines are built with a specific programming language
			in mind. Code generation for the relevant language(s) for the
			framework/engine should occur for all Ecsact files in the project. An
			<a>Ecsact codegen plugin</a> may need to be created along side your
			integration if your language(s) are not available already.
		</li>
		<li>
			<h5 id="execution-events" class="font-bold inline text-base">
				Execution Events
			</h5>
			— <code>ecsact_execution_events_collector</code> is a C struct that
			contains callbacks for receiving various Ecsact component events. The
			callbacks require low level free functions which can be error-prone to set
			correctly and there may only be one per event. Appropriate wrapper
			functions for registering event multiple listeners are recommended for an
			integration implementation. Using generated types from the
			<a [routerLink]="[]" fragment="relevant-codegen"
				>built-in relevant language code generators</a
			>
			is also recommended to be used in said wrappers.
		</li>
		<li>
			<h5 id="execution-options-queue" class="font-bold inline text-base">
				Execution Options Queue
			</h5>
			— <code>ecsact_execution_options</code> is a C struct that contains
			instructions for manipulating components and entities before execution and
			adding actions for execution. The struct requirements are error-prone and
			may require careful memory allocation. Appropriate wrapper functions for
			adding component details, entity details, and append actions are
			recommended for an integration implementation. Using generated types from
			the
			<a [routerLink]="[]" fragment="relevant-codegen"
				>built-in relevant language code generators</a
			>
			is also recommended to be used in said wrappers.
		</li>
		<li>
			<h5 id="editor-gui-create-entity" class="font-bold inline text-base">
				Editor GUI to create starting entities
			</h5>
			— Often developers have several entities that are not generated by
			systems. It can be painful to ask a developer to create a script to create
			these entities. Integrating some GUI so that an entity may be placed in a
			scene/map/level is often more <em>ergonomic</em>.
		</li>
		<li>
			<h5 id="entity-sync" class="font-bold inline text-base">
				Entity Synchronization
			</h5>
			— Engines/frameworks commonly have an <em>object</em> or similar that
			represents <em>something</em> in the application. Synchronizing an entity
			to that <em>something</em> to make it a 1:1 relationship can be useful to
			combine the tools available in the engine/framework with Ecsact component
			data and component events. While this is a powerful concept, it comes at a
			cost. If the developer is working with thousands (or even millions) of
			entities the engine/framework may not work well at that scale. For that
			reason entity synchronization is recommended as an
			<em>opt-in</em> abstraction. Furthermore, it is encouraged that entity
			synchronization (if enabled) also work on a subset of entities instead of
			all entities.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="ecsact-build">Ecsact Build</h3>
	<p>
		It is highly recommended that an integration provide a convenient way to
		build an Ecsact Runtime shared library. Integration should be as simple as
		collecting all the <code>.ecsact</code> files and executing
		<code>ecsact build</code> with said ecsact files. Additionally providing a
		convenient way for the user to select a build recipe is encouraged.
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>ecsact build</code> can be configured to output JSON that you should
		able to easily read when making your integration. See
		<code>ecsact build --help</code> for the available flags.
